   B. data_analysis_bootstrap_rust.html
      
        Code used to for meta-analysis, including raw differences for soybean rust severity, yield, 100-seed-weight, and ancillary diseases (Cercospora blight and target spot) and the standardized mean differences for these variables under differing moderator variables.
        
   C. data_analysis_bootstrap_yield.html

   D. data_analysis_bootstrap_seedwt.html

   E. results_processing.html

   F. results_plotting.html

	Program (code, comments, and output figures) used to create the graphs used in the manuscript.
                
   G. workspace.csv
      
        This is the data that is read into the R program "data_processing.R," where it is further processed for analysis. The final, cleaned data used in the rust, yield, and seed-weight analyses can be found in items H, I, and J, below, respectively.
        
   H. rust_data_cleaned.csv

	This is the data that is used in the rust severity bootstrapping analysis. It is based off of the workspace.csv data, but it has been cleaned with data_processing program.

   I. yield_data_cleaned.csv

	This is the data that is used in the yield bootstrapping analysis. It is based off of the workspace.csv data, but it has been cleaned with data_processing program.

   J. seedwt_data_cleaned.csv

	This is the data that is used in the 100-seed-weight bootstrapping analysis. It is based off of the workspace.csv data, but it has been cleaned with data_processing program.

   K. publication_summary.csv
      
        This is a summary table of all publications/studies used in the meta-analysis. (Used as Table 1 in the manuscript)

   L. Rscripts.zip

	This is the zipped .R files that contain the R programs for analysis and graphing. 

2. Relationship between files:  The raw data (“workspace.csv”) is read into "data_processing.html” program and made ready (and saved) for analysis of XXX (where XXX is either rust severity, yield, or 100-seed-weight) in "data_analysis_bootstrap_XXX.html.” The analysis results are read into “results_processing.html” where results are combined and made into a format for graphing. Then, the cleaned results are read into “result_graphing.html” where figures for the publication are produced. The Rscripts.zip contains all the R codes and they are saved in the .R files. The R codes were written in R-oxygen, which were converted to .Rmd files then to the html files in this dataset. 


3. Additional related data collected that was not included in the current data package: NA

4. Are there multiple versions of the dataset? No, just this final version used in analysis (which is duplicated here and at https://github.com/aaarchmiller/fungicide_meta_analysis)

METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------


1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 

We identified fungicide trials conducted on soybean for the control of SBR by performing a search of Plant Disease Management Reports (PDMRs), Fungicide and Nematicide Tests (FNTs), and other related review articles from January 2005 to July 2014.  We also included data from unpublished fungicide trials that were conducted in Alabama during the 2009, 2010, and 2013 growing seasons (Dennis Delaney, personal communication) (Table 1).  Inclusion criteria required that the articles be primary, replicated studies that used foliar application of fungicide with a minimum of three replications in addition to a control treatment (i.e., no fungicide application).  We also limited the time period of studies from 2005 (the first full year SBR was present in the U.S.) through 2014 and geographical range to five southeastern states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi) where significant yield losses from SBR have been observed in commercial fields and research plots (Allen et al. 2014). 
We recorded data from each study that met the inclusion criteria above, and the final meta-analysis reference list is given in Table 1. For each study, we recorded a unique study ID, study location (state), fungicide trade name, active ingredients (Table 2), fungicide class (Table 2), number of applications (Table 3), growth stage of the soybean plants at each application (Table 3), study year (Table 3), number of experimental replicates, amount of fungicide applied (Table 2), and mean SBR severity, yield, and 100-seed-weight in treated and control plants.  When applicable, we converted yield from bushels per acre to kg ha-1 for analysis. The level of SBR infection at the time of fungicide application was not reported in any of the fungicide trials; however we used mean SBR severity from the untreated control plants as checks to quantify the degree to which disease pressure was present (Table 3). After collecting data, we further excluded data from any studies that did not report SBR severity or where the mean severity in untreated control plants was <5% following Scherm et al. (2009) (Table 1). We only considered a moderator category for analysis when there were at least 15 entries from at least 5 different studies. 


2. Methods for processing the data:

First, the full raw data was subset to include only relevant fields needed for analysis. Secondly, moderator categorical variables and names were standardized. When there were less than 5 effect sizes for a particular moderator category, those records were included in the "other" category. After these steps, data was subset into five separate files, including one dataset each for the soybean rust data; the yield data; the 100-seed-weight data; the Cercospora blight data and the target spot data.

Disease severity was either reported directly in percentages or on varying scales, so we transformed all disease severity scales into percentages for consistent cross-study comparisons. Studies published with the 0-8 scale represented disease severity as follows: 0 to 1 = 0 to 2.5%, >1 to 2 = 2.5 to 5%, >2 to 3 = 5 to 10%, >3 to 4 = 10-15%, >4 to 5 = 15 to 25%, >5 to 6 = 25 to 35%, >6 to 7 = 35 to 67.5%, and >7 to 8 = 67.5 to 100% (e.g., see meta-analysis reference Sikora, and Delaney 2013a).  Studies that published SBR values on the 0-10 scale represented disease severity as follows: 1 to 3 = 0 to 2.5%, >3 to 4 = 2.5 to 5%, >4 to 5 = 5 to 10%, >5 to 6 = 10-15%, >6 to 7 = 15 to 25%, >7 to 8 = 25 to 35%, >8 to 9 = 35 to 67.5%, >9 to 10 = 67.5 to 100% (e.g., see meta-analysis reference Padgett and Purvis 2005b). We imputed disease severity as a percentage based on a constant rate of change between scalar values (Shah and Dillard 2006).  For instance, if mean SBR severity was given as 4.5 out of 10, we calculated the SBR severity in percentage form as 7.5% (i.e., 0.5 of the distance between a value of 4 and a value of 5).
  
All the steps for data processing are in the R program "data_processing.html.”

All data analyses were conducted with the package, metafor, in R.  We calculated the log response ratio from each treatment-specific entry i from each study as:ln⁡(R) =ln⁡(yt/yc), where yt is the mean value from the treated plants and yc is the mean value from the control plants. If a treatment mean SBR severity was 0, we converted it to 0.0001; however, we only included data when the control mean SBR severity was ≥5%. All meta-analyses entries were weighted by the level of disease pressure as defined by the mean SBR severity from untreated control plants. We analyzed mean log response ratios using random-effects models with a Restricted Maximized Likelihood Estimator and evaluated overall means and 95% confidence intervals with cluster-level (i.e., study-level) bootstrapping.
