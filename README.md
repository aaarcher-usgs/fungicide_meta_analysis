METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION
--------------------------


1. Description of methods used for collection/generation of data: 
  We identified relevant articles by performing a search of Plant Disease Management Reports, Fungicide and Nematicide Tests, and other related review articles from January 2004 to July 2014.  We also included data from unpublished studies.  Inclusion criteria required that the articles be primary, replicated studies that used foliar application of fungicide with a minimum of three replications in addition to a control treatment (i.e., no fungicide application).  We also limited the time period of studies from 2004 (the initial date of infection discovered in the US) through 2014 and studies were geographically limited to five states in the southeastern US (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Mississippi). 

  We recorded data from each study including a unique study ID, study year, study location (state), fungicide trade name, active ingredients, fungicide class, number of applications, the growth stage of the soybean plants at each application, number of experimental replications, disease severity (i.e., SBR, Cercospora blight, and target spot), soybean yield, and 100-seed-weight. 


2. Methods for processing the data: <describe how the submitted data were generated from the raw or collected data>
  First, the full raw data was subset to include only relevant fields needed for analysis. Secondly, moderator categorical variables and names were standardized. When there were less than 5 effect sizes for a particular moderator category, those records were included in the "other" category. After these steps, data was subset into five separate files, including one dataset each for the soybean rust data; the yield data; the 100-seed-weight data; the Cercospora blight data and the target spot data.

  Disease severity was either reported directly in percentages or on varying scales, so we transformed disease severity scales into percentages for cross-study comparisons. Values on the 0-5 scale represented disease severity as follows: 0 to 1 = 0 to 10%, >1 to 2 = 10 to 25%, >2 to 3 = 25 to 50%, >3 to 4 = 50 to 75%, and >4 to 5 = 75 to 100%. Values on the 0-8 scale represented disease severity as follows: 0 to 1 = 0 to 2.5%, >1 to 2 = 2.5 to 5%, >2 to 3 = 5 to 10%, >3 to 4 = 10-15%, >4 to 5 = 15 to 25%, >5 to 6 = 25 to 35%, >6 to 7 = 35 to 67.5%, and >7 to 8 = 67.5 to 100%. Soybean rust values on the 0-10 scale represented severity as follows: 1 to 3 = 0 to 2.5%, >3 to 4 = 2.5 to 5%, >4 to 5 = 5 to 10%, >5 to 6 = 10-15%, >6 to 7 = 15 to 25%, >7 to 8 = 25 to 35%, >8 to 9 = 35 to 67.5%, >9 to 10 = 67.5 to 100%. We imputed percentages from these scalar values by assuming linear trends over the range in scalar values. 
  
  Finally, the raw and standardized effect sizes were calculated and the data was saved to "data/output_data/data_cleaned.R" All the steps for data processing are in the R program "data_processing.R."
